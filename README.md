Greetings Tech-no-logical World!
  TEAMWORK
    With collective action or joint effort, nothing stands in your way.  If youare fair, ethical, and not overbearing, others will aid and support your objectives.  If the person leading does not abuse their position, a good outcome can be expected.
    
    Expect disruption or failure if things are not in order or if your associates are not coordinated or cooperating.
    Your affairs will not be managed well from a distance or if no one has clear authority.  Benefit everyone you serve.
    Misfortune results when correct order is interrupted.  Some things can not be managed effectively by committee.
    There are times when it is strategically wise to retreat.  There is neither shame nor blame in such a decision.
    At no time must a breakdown in organization or direction be permitted.  The results would be disasterous.
    Everyone participating in a success must be fairly rewarded and credited according to their contribution and ability.
